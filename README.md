# Solutions to Competitive Programming problems

This repository is personal, made public in the hope that someone may find it useful, but:
 -   Solutions may not be best in algorithmic complexity terms.
 -   Solutions may have been written in a rush during a contest and may not make any sense.
 -   Solutions may be even only partially correct(can not work perfectly for all test cases)

So, in summary, if a solution seems stupid, it probably is. I do not offer support for these solutions. I'm not interested in fixes to existing solutions or new solutions, feel free to fork / create your own if you want to share better / other solutions.

I do try to include only working solutions (without guarantees), written by me. When external code is used, it's usually marked as such. If you find some borrowed code which is not properly indicated as such, please let me know and I'll fix it.
